 him access to the model and previous year question papers for that particular course. Students can look on or download the papers along  
 with their solutions from here.

 specific subject gives them access to the form from where they can see the existing question papers and solutions or upload them when a  
 new examination is around the corner.
 
 
 The manager of the database is the only one who can access every part of the database and can do upload or download of any paper and its 
 solutions. He is also the one who verifies the details during the sigh in process of the students and teachers. The verification is done,
 so that the students or teachers cannot get access to the subject papers that they don’t study or teach.
